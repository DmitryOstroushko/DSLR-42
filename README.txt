1. Data description:
    1) <dataset>:
        For TRAIN DATASET:
            Dimension: 1601 * 19
            Array of 1601 rows: header, 1600 rows with data
            Single row consists from 19 values: index, name of house, 4 columns with information about student, 13 features

            <dataset> is split on 3 part: see 2) - 4)

    2) <houses>: sorted list of names of houses (List[str])

    3) <features>: list of names of features (List[str])
        For TRAIN DATASET:
            Dimension: 14 columns: 1st name for "house name" + 13 names of features
            This structure is due to correspond <data> array

    4) <data>: two-dimensional array with values of features
        For TRAIN DATASET:
            Dimension: 1600 * 14
